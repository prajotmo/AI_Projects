# üß† Next Word Prediction using Bidirectional LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict the next word in a sentence using a deep learning model built with a Bidirectional LSTM in Python. The model is trained on a text corpus and learns to suggest the most likely next word based on input sequences.
